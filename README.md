# Hidden-HID
Hidden HID is tiny USB device that can be concealed entirely inside a USB A port. 
Once inserted it is almost invisible to those unaware of its presence.

It consists of a single 8x12x0.4mm PCB with USB contacts on the top layer and an STM32 on the bottom.
The additional height required to maintain contact with the USB pins is achieved with 3 LEDs soldered to the pads on either side. These are not electrically connected.
